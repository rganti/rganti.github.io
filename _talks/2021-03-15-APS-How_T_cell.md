T cells exhibit remarkable sensitivity and selectivity in detecting and responding to agonist peptides (p) bound to MHC molecules in a sea of self pMHC molecules. Despite much work, understanding of the underlying mechanisms of distinguishing such ligands remains incomplete. Here, we quantify T cell discriminatory capacity using channel capacity, a direct measure of the signaling networkâ€™s ability to discriminate between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) displaying either self ligands or a mixture of self and agonist ligands. This metric shows how differences in information content between these two types of peptidomes are decoded by network topology, feedback loops, and rates of kinetic proofreading signaling steps inside T cells. Using channel capacity, we constructed numerically substantiated hypotheses to explain the discriminatory role of a recently identified slow LAT Y132 phosphorylation step. Biochemical and imaging experiments support these findings.
