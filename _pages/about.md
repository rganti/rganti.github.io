I am an experienced researcher with a passion for deep learning and its applications to finance and health care. As a Ph.D. student in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, I developed molecular dynamics simulations to make fundamental theoretical contributions towards understanding non-equilibrium nano-scale flow.
Projects included some of the first non-equilibrium calculations of nanoscale flow profiles induced by temperature and chemical potential gradients. Subsequently, as a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I used methods from information theory to quantify immune cell signal discrimination between healthy and infected cells. I also developed kinetic Monte Carlo methods to optimize vaccination protocols against highly mutable pathogens. All of this work resulted in numerous [publications](https://rganti.github.io/publications/).

Recently, I began working on a startup in an effort to apply methods from deep reinforcement learning and machine translation to algorithmic trading and financial portfolio optimization.
On the side, I have been doing consulting projects for a few A.I. startups in finance and health care.
