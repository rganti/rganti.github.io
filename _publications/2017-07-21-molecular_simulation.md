excerpt: 'Thermo-osmotic slip—-the flow induced by a thermal gradient along a surface—-is a well-known phenomenon, but curiously there is a lack of robust molecular-simulation techniques to predict its magnitude. Here, we compare three different molecular-simulation techniques to compute the thermo-osmotic slip at a simple solid-fluid interface. Although we do not expect the different approaches to be in perfect agreement, we find that the differences are barely significant for a range of different physical conditions, suggesting that practical molecular simulations of thermo-osmotic slip are feasible.'
