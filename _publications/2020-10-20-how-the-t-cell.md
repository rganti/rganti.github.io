excerpt: 'Information theory was invented to solve the task of sending reliable communication over an unreliable channel. T cells have extremely reliable signal-processing capacity as they sensitively and specifically respond to a few pathogen-derived peptide ligands displayed in the noisy environment of many self-derived ligands presented on the same antigen-presenting cell. We used information-theoretic concepts to analyze a computational model of the biochemical steps in the T cell signaling network to understand how features of the T cell signaling pathway enable discriminatory ability. Our calculations and experiments suggest that T cells superimpose kinetic proofreading steps that must be spatially localized with the receptor and feedback loops to extract reliable information from a noisy environment.'
